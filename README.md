This project showcases a collection of applied AI tools developed using large language models (LLMs) for real-world document and customer service automation tasks.  
It includes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and OpenAI function calling, a multimodal support assistant capable of processing text and image inputs, and an audio-to-action pipeline that structures meeting recordings into notes and follow-ups. 
Built with a focus on modular design, agentic workflows, and production-readiness, this repository reflects hands-on experience with LLM integration, prompt engineering, vector search (Pinecone), and multimodal AI interfaces.
